# Startups-Success-Rate-Prediction
# 🚀 Startup Success Rate Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Startup Success Rate Prediction** project aims to predict whether a startup is likely to **succeed or fail** based on key business, financial, and operational factors.  
Using **machine learning techniques**, this project analyzes historical startup data to identify patterns that influence success, helping **investors, founders, and analysts** make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many startups fail due to poor planning, lack of funding, weak market fit, or inefficient execution.  
This project builds a **predictive machine learning model** to estimate the **probability of startup success** using structured startup-related features.
